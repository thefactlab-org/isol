# Concept [Concept design for isol]

## Overview

![imag](/design.png)

A dedicated interface that defines standards and structural patterns for smart contracts written in Solidity.
It is developed based on OpenZeppelin standards to ensure security, reliability, and compatibility. This architecture presents a structured and scalable approach to building smart contracts. It follows a layered design that starts from standards and core components, then extends functionality through kits and flexible modular components.

The goal of this architecture is to:

- Provide a simple, fast, and highly usable development experience
- Encourage concise, clean code in just a few lines
- Enable easy customization and expansion
- Ensure security and reliability (OpenZeppelin standards)

## Base

The fundamental contract layer used as the foundation for developing other smart contracts.
It provides the essential core functionalities required to build and operate smart contracts.

- Core smart contract structures
- Fundamental logic
- Essential building blocks

## Kit

A collection of ready-to-use extensions that add new features and enhanced capabilities to Base contracts.
It helps speed up development while reducing complexity.

- Ready-to-use features
- Pre-built enhancements
- Extensions that plug directly into Base contracts
- Faster development
- Built-in functionality
- Less boilerplate

## Modular

A modular extension layer designed for building highly flexible and customizable smart contracts.
Developers can freely select, combine, or integrate different modules depending on their specific needs.

- Highly configurable extensions
- Add or remove features as needed
- Suitable for advanced or specialized smart contracts
